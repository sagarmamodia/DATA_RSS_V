## Project Description

The project utilized various features related to demographics, lifestyle, and psychological factors to assess potential 
mental health conditions. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using metrics like accuracy and AUC.
The goal was to create an accessible tool that could provide preliminary insights into users' mental well-being, aiding 
in early detection and awareness.

## Dataset

Name and source of the dataset used.
Data preprocessing steps (if any).
Licensing or usage restrictions (if applicable).

## Model Architecture

Describe the model used (CNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc.).
Mention any modifications or optimizations made.
Provide a summary of hyperparameters and training settings.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository on your local system (git clone)
2. Install Dependences using
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Copy the test dataset to the directory (let's say it is named test.csv)
5. Run the following script to get predictions
    `python predict_mental_health.py test.csv`
    

## Evaluation & Performance

    Metrics used for evaluation (Accuracy, AUC, F1-score, etc.).
    Model performance summary with tables/graphs (if applicable).
    Comparisons with baseline models.

## Deployment

    Details of how the model is deployed (Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, etc.).
    Instructions to run the web app or API.

## Results & Visualizations

    Sample predictions or outputs.
    Any relevant visualizations (Confusion matrix, ROC curves, etc.).
